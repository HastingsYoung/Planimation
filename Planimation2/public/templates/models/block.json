    "domaindescription": "The goal is to assemble a complex object made out of subassemblies. The sequence of steps must obey a given partial order. In addition, through poor engineering design, many subassemblies must be installed temporarily in one assembly, then removed and given a permanent home in another. This domain was created by Drew McDermott.",
